# Thermal Physics
Here is some writing about some key ideas in Thermal Physics

### Equilibrium State and State Variables
An equilibrium state of a system is one where we can reasonably describe the system with its few bulk parameters. The system properties of the system (the state variables) need to be homogenous throughout the system for us to be able to describe it in this way. For example, if a gas were to have a position-dependent temperature, we wouldn’t be able to describe the gas with the parameters pressure and volume. This is because pressure would essentially be a function of position, rather than a straightforward ‘number’ describing the gas at large. This is in contrast to volume: the volume of the gas is simply a number, which describes the gas as a whole. It wouldn’t make sense to talk about a “position-dependent volume”, since volume is a property of the gas as a *whole*.
